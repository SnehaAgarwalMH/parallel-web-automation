# CI/CD Process

This repository uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). GitHub Actions automates the build, test, and deployment processes when code changes are pushed to the repository.

## Workflow
The CI/CD workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Build**: The workflow builds the project using the specified build tools and dependencies.
2. **Test**: Automated tests are run to ensure the code's correctness and reliability.
3. **Deploy**: If the tests pass successfully, the workflow deploys the application to the target environment.

## Configuration
The CI/CD process is configured using the `.github/workflows` directory in the repository. YAML files define the workflows and specify the steps to be executed. You can customize the workflows based on your project's requirements.

## Deployment
Deployment configurations and target environments are defined in the GitHub Actions settings. Ensure that the deployment process aligns with your project's deployment strategy.

## Documentation
For detailed information on setting up and configuring the CI/CD workflows, refer to the [CI/CD Documentation](/docs/cicd-docs.md).

## Contributions
Contributions to improving the CI/CD process are welcome. Please follow our contribution guidelines for details on how to get involved.
